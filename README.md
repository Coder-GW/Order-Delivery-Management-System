# Order-Delivery-Management-System

The proposed system will digitize the management of customer orders and deliveries for a hardware distribution company. It will allow staff to create, view, update, and delete order records, including customer details, requested goods, delivery locations, payment information, and scheduled delivery times. Orders will be organized using a first-come, first-served priority system to ensure timely processing.

The system will also support the assignment of delivery vehicles and drivers to specific jobs to improve scheduling and resource use. All order and delivery updates will occur in real time, ensuring accurate and consistent information across staff members. Automated reminders and alerts will notify users of upcoming deliveries and pending tasks. Additionally, the system will provide delivery tracking and generate management reports to support performance monitoring and decision-making.
